# SuperSimpleDev - game Rock Paper Scissors

This is a mini-project from the [JavaScript Tutorial Full Course - Beginner to Pro (2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerdGm-ehJQ&t=29617s). The course helped improve my coding skills by creating realistic projects.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JS

### What I learned

```html
<button
  class="calculator-button gray-button"
  onclick="
  updateCalculation('1');
"
>
  1
</button>
```

```js
let calculation = localStorage.getItem("calculation") || "0";
localStorage.setItem("calculation", calculation);
```

```js
eval(calculation);
```

```js
let lastNumber = calculation.split(/[\+\-\*\/]/).pop();
```

### Continued development

In the future, I want to be fluent in the JS programming language, and use it confidently for DOM.

### Useful resources

- [the JS course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerdGm-ehJQ&t=29617s) - The course helped improve my coding skills by creating realistic projects.
- [auxiliary for studying](https://github.com/SuperSimpleDev/javascript-course/tree/main/1-exercise-solutions) - There are solutions for the entire course task.
